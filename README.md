3 Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict breast cancer diagnoses using classification techniques such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest. The primary goal is to aid early detection, which plays a critical role in effective treatment.

## Objectives
- Analyze the dataset to uncover important patterns and insights.
- Preprocess the data for optimal model performance.
- Implement and evaluate multiple classification models to identify the most effective approach.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
