# Breast-Cancer-diagnosis-prediction

# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict breast cancer diagnosis using various classification techniques, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest. The model is designed to assist in early detection, which is crucial for effective treatment.

Objectives
To explore the dataset and understand the underlying patterns.
To preprocess the data for modeling.
To implement multiple classification algorithms and compare their performance.
Technologies Used
Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
